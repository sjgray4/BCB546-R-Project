Hello Stephen!

Your code ran without a hitch on my computer and gave me the files that your README said that it would. 
I struggled to figure out how to switch "?" to "-" but you did it pretty easily so good job!
Your file inspection was done throughly.
Maybe you could just use the dim command instead of ncol since doesn't it give you basically the same thing? 
It would be good if you could actually save the graphs and put them into an individual file for your visualization part.
When seperating Maize increasing and decreasing files and the teosinte, your code was super efficient omg!
I wish you also added your own visualization or at least wrote what you were considering to do for that part. 
Looks great and throughly done! Great job!
